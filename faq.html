    <h1>9. FAQs</h1>
    <p>
        <h2>Q. If I get an FR Grade in a minor course, do I need to repeat the
        course? And will it reflect in my final transcript?</h2>
        A. No, you do not need to repeat the course. However, an
        'FR' grade will reflect on the course, under the additional
        courses done.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Q. What's the difference between an ALC, Audit and sitting through
        a course?</h2>
        A. Additional Learning Courses (ALCs) do not count towards your
        CPI but are involved in tagging - if you tag it later as an elective,
        the grade you get then counts in your CPI. When you audit a course, you
        do it without obtaining a grade - you get an "AU" on
        successful completion of the course, which does not carry grade points.
        Formal registration is required for both these, and they appear on your
        transcript. But for sitting through a course, you don't need to
        register for it, nor does it appear on your transcript.

        <h2>Q. If one gets an FR in Elective HS xxx, do
        they need to repeat the same course or can they take up Elective
        HS yyy in its place?</h2>
        A. Yes, they can take yyy as their
        HSS elective by changing the tag of HS xxx to
        additional learning and registering for yyy in the
        next semester as HSS-Elective.
    </p>

        <h2>Q. What about the credits when one does some honor courses but not
        enough for an honors degree?</h2>
        A. If one has completed some honor courses
        but not enough to
        acquire an honors degree, then those courses would be counted under
        Additional learning Courses. Some departments allow to tag these as
        Department/other electives as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Q. Suppose I take up any other random subject course, but I don't
        want to get a minor; will that course show up anywhere while passing
        out?</h2>
        A. The grade that you obtained in the course will show up in the
        transcript. All the courses taken up as a minor are converted to an ALC
        unless you have completed 30 prescribed minor credits in a particular
        department.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Q. Can I take a minor course through the main registration window?</h2>
        A. One cannot take a minor course through a main registration
        window if the 'minor course tag' has been allotted through the
        pre registration window.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Q. Can I take a course which is ONLY running as a minor course as an
        elective course?</h2>
        A. If a course is only running as a minor course [Way to
        check:
        ASC>Academics>All About Courses] - If there is no other entry of
        the course apart from the section 'M', then it means it is only
        running as a minor course. If the course is only running as a minor
        'section' course, one cannot take it as an elective tag through
        the main registration. Example - MG courses last Autumn Semester. One
        can later, [during graduation/retagging] however tag them as minor
        courses with the permission of their [parent] department.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Q. Where can I see the waitlist of a pre registered course?</h2>
        A. You are automatically enrolled into the waitlist of the higher
        preference courses once the minor allocation has been done. You will be
        automatically enrolled in a higher preference course in the main
        registration window if a seat is available in the course. A student
        cannot see their waitlist number or the waitlist of the pre registered
        course in the main registration window.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Q. Can I go back to my lower preference if I got my higher preference
        and I didn't freeze my lower preference?</h2>
        A. No, not in any case will
        you be allowed to move to your lower
        preference if you have been allotted a higher preference. Hence, you are
        always advised to fill in your preferences carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Q. Can I register for a course in the FCFS waitlist in the main
        registration window of a minor course which is offered through pre
        registration?</h2>
        A. There is no FCFS waitlist for minor courses offered
        through
        pre registration. If the course is also running as an elective course,
        the course can be taken up from the main registration window.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Q. A course has a prerequisite, but not mentioned on ASC.</h2>
        A. Please follow the information mentioned on the department
        website. You can also report it to the appropriate authority.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Q. How many preferences can I fill in the pre registration window? Till
        when can I change it?</h2>
        A. Any student can fill in as many preferences in the pre
        registration interface. They can change it till the deadline of the
        closing of the interface. Important to note - Pre registration is NOT
        first come first serve basis.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Q. How do I figure out which courses are allowed by my department as
        department or institute electives?</h2>
        A. You should do the registration in
        consultation with your
        faculty advisor. As such, there is a list approved by the DUGC/DPGC of
        the department for which the courses are approved as department
        electives. Please ask your faculty advisor or Department General
        Secretary to help. If you want to take up some course which you think
        needs approval, ask your faculty advisor!
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Q. How do I know which courses are running as minor courses?</h2>
        A. The courses running as minor courses are updated on running
        courses and on the IIT Bombay Academic Website.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Q. One of the minor courses is available but I am still not able to
        register for it through the main registration.</h2>
        A. Please check the
        running courses, if the course isn't
        running as a normal course [without the 'M' section], it
        won't be allowed to be registered in the main reg window.
