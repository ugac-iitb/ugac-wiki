      <h1>3. Why Should One Take Up a Minor</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Minor courses allow you to officially explore a department other than
            yours while at the same time getting credit for it. It adds value to
            your major degree and can be a gateway to get opportunities in the
            field you have completed your minor in.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your minor degree can give you sufficient knowledge to enable you to
            take part in interdisciplinary research and even pursue your higher
            studies in such fields.
        </li>
        <li>
            Though a minor degree can be pursued simply out of genuine and deep
            interest in a particular department without any specific end goal in
            view, for the general majority, you should select it in such a way
            that it either suits your major degree in a research-oriented
            interdisciplinary manner or in a generic way to any engineer or
            scientist.
        </li>
        <li>
            You should also look at how all the minor courses fit in with each
            other for a more holistic approach; some departments draw up a
            suggested schedule of when each minor course must be taken to reap the
            full benefits out of the curriculum.
        </li>
        <li>
            Minor courses don't count in your CPI, so you should select a
            minor based on your interest.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>4. Why Should One Take Up Honors</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Honor courses are either advanced-level courses in your department or
            are courses designed to give you more exposure to different areas in
            your department. It is like a specialization in your own
            discipline.
        </li>
        <li>
            Honors research topics are varied and negotiable &mdash; if you are
            really interested in a topic and want to learn more about it,
            you'll be encouraged and supported.
        </li>
        <li>
            From a potential employer's perspective, whatever your
            department, it appears laudable to have demonstrated the ability to
            achieve a complex and demanding goal and have in-depth knowledge in
            your department.
        </li>
        <li>
            It helps you prepare you for higher studies or to take a job in a
            particular specialized area so that you can compete with, say, an
            M.Tech who has specialized in the same area; there are also higher
            chances that your profile will get noticed by universities for their
            MS/Ph.D. programs.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>5. Tagging Rules</h1>
    <p>
        Every course you do in the institute falls under one of the categories
        of courses as described earlier. Tags are given to courses to classify
        them. This facility allows students to do additional courses and finally
        make select courses count towards "Core CPI" (the CPI of
        prescribed curriculum credits)
    </p>
    <p>Tags of courses:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Core Course - C</li>
        <li>Department Elective - D</li>
        <li>Interdisciplinary STEM Elective - SE</li>
        <li>Interdisciplinary HASMED Elective - HE</li>
        <li>Minor Course - M</li>
        <li>Additional Learning Courses - T</li>
        <li>Honors Course - O</li>
        <li>Honors Elective - E</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        An approved change of tag will result in fresh calculation of SPI/ CPI
        from the semester. The tag change has been made effective due to the
        fact that additional learning course(s) do NOT constitute the core SPI/
        CPI of a student.
