   <h1>6. Research</h1>
      <h2>6.1. Supervised Learning Project (SLP)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Supervised Learning Project (SLP), also known as RnD in some
            departments, is a project-based course - generally for 6 credits,
            where a student can work for one entire semester on a project under a
            professor.
        </li>
        <li>
            It is not always necessary to do a project under a professor in your
            department.
        </li>
        <li>
            The professor you choose can be from a different department, but it
            is subject to rules and conditions laid down by your department.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>6.2. B.Tech. Project</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            B.Tech. projects (BTPs) may be offered as a single unit of 12 credits
            (BTP) or as 6 credits of BTP-I followed by BTP-II of 6 credits or 12
            credits.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wherever it is split into two units, BTP - I becomes a pre- requisite
            for BTP &ndash; II.
        </li>
        <li>
            Departments may prescribe a minimum performance in BTP - I (which may
            be higher than the pass grade ‘DD') for being eligible for
            BTP - II.
        </li>
        <li>
            BTP - I and BTP - II are separately graded, at the end of the
            respective semesters.
        </li>
        <li>
            These projects are supervised, and need regular interaction (at least
            once a week) with the supervisor.
        </li>
        <li>
            Students have to submit a project report and present it in front of a
            panel of examiners.
        </li>
        <li>
            The dates for submission of reports, the dates for presentations, and
            details of mode of assessment are decided by the individual
            departments.
        </li>
        <li>
            Both BTPs are counted in CPI calculation.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>6.3. Undergraduate Research Awards (URA)</h2>
    <p>
        The Undergraduate Research Awards (URA) is a program designed for
        students with a strong inclination toward research. It aims to recognize
        and document their research and developmental efforts at three levels:
        URA01, URA02, and URA03. Each award is independent and reflects the
        student's contributions and achievements. These awards are listed in
        the Transcript.
    </p>
    <p>URA 01</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            For preliminary research/ developmental experience for any 1st/2nd
            /3rd year   UG  students.
        </li>
        <li>
            You need to take prior approval from DUGC with a signed application
            by the guide.
        </li>
        <li>
            Upon completion of the project (4-6 months including summer/winter
            vacations) you need to fill the URA 01 form and submit it to DUGC via
            GSec.
        </li>
        <li>
            No credits are given for this, it just appears on the transcript with
            a PP grade in the immediate next semester.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>URA 02</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Recognition of truly exceptional work, both in quality and in extent,
            done in the BTP, is only for B.Tech students, not for DD
            students.
        </li>
        <li>
            Additional 6 credits with an AA is given for URA 02. Hence, it will
            improve your CPI.
        </li>
        <li>
            You compulsorily need to do two BTPs one in 7th and another in 8th
            semester.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your work will be evaluated by a committee formed by the DUGC and
            then the recommendation is sent to the UGAPEC.
        </li>
        <li>
            After BTP 2 you can apply for URA 02 by filling the form and
            submitting it to the DUGC via GSec.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>URA 03</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Recognition of truly exceptional work, both in quality and in extent,
            done in the DDP.
        </li>
        <li>
            Only for DD students.
        </li>
        <li>
            You compulsorily need to do two DDPs one in 9th and another in 10th
            semester as DD requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
            Additional 6 credits with an AA is given for URA 03. Hence, it will
            improve your CPI.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your work will be evaluated by a committee formed by the DUGC and
            then the recommendation is sent to the UGAPEC.
        </li>
        <li>
            After DDP 2 you can apply for URA 03 by filling the form and
            submitting it to the DUGC via GSec.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>7. IDDDP</h1>
    <p>
        The Interdisciplinary Dual Degree Program (IDDDP) is an academic
        initiative that allows undergraduate students to pursue an additional
        master's degree in a specialized interdisciplinary area by extending
        their studies by one year. This program is designed to enable students
        to combine their core undergraduate discipline with advanced knowledge
        in an emerging or allied field.
    </p>
    <p>
        This program can prove to be beneficial for many students due to the
        following reasons :
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            It's great for students who've discovered a new interest in
            another field through courses, projects, or self-study.
        </li>
        <li>
            It helps you complete a masters degree in an additional 1 year
            instead of 2.
        </li>
        <li>
            It helps students who chose a branch based on popular opinion but now
            want to follow their true passion.
        </li>
        <li>
            It encourages deeper learning and better research because students
            are more motivated.
        </li>
        <li>
            It also matches the growing need for multi-skilled people in
            industries.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For more info about the IDDD Program, please refer to the IDDDP
        Booklet.

    <h1>8. Semester Exchange</h1>
    <p>
        The Semester Exchange Program at IIT Bombay is a chance to study abroad
        for one semester at one of IIT Bombay's partner universities. IIT
        Bombay signs Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with various institutions
        worldwide, many of which facilitate academic exchanges. MoUs lay the
        groundwork for how these will work - student eligibility,
        departments/schools and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
        Spending a semester abroad has several advantages:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Study at top international universities<br>Take unique courses not
            offered at IITB
        </li>
        <li>
            Exposure to different cultures and perspectives
        </li>
        <li>
            Build a global network of friends and contacts
        </li>
        <li>
            Improve soft skills like adaptability, independence,
            communication
        </li>
        <li>
            Learn how academics and research work in other countries
        </li>
        <li>
            Students who go on to tertiary studies find themselves more
            comfortable in ‘foreign' environments.
        </li>
        <li>
            Prospective employers in almost every field look favorably upon
            experience gained while living overseas and knowledge obtained of
            another language and culture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Increased pressure to communicate and relate to others develops an
            awareness of group dynamics and personal sensitivity towards
            others.
        </li>
        <li>
            Successful program completion represents an excellent measure of
            personal flexibility, encompassing an ability to reach compromise,
            focus and succeed through challenging times.
        </li>
    </ul>
